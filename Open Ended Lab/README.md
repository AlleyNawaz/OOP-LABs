# Open Ended Lab

This directory contains open-ended lab assignments that require creative problem-solving and implementation.

## Structure

Each open-ended lab should be organized in its own subdirectory.

### Example:
```
Open Ended Lab/
├── OEL1/
│   ├── source/
│   ├── documentation.md
│   └── README.md
```

## Guidelines

- Open-ended labs typically require more comprehensive solutions
- Include proper documentation explaining your approach
- Add design diagrams or flowcharts where applicable
- Ensure code is well-structured and follows OOP principles
