# Project

This directory contains the course project(s).

## Structure

Each project should be well-organized with proper documentation.

### Example:
```
Project/
├── ProjectName/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── docs/
│   ├── tests/
│   └── README.md
```

## Guidelines

- Projects should demonstrate comprehensive understanding of OOP concepts
- Include complete documentation (requirements, design, implementation)
- Follow software engineering best practices
- Include UML diagrams where appropriate
- Provide clear build and run instructions
