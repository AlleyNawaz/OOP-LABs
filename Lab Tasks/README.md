# Lab Tasks

This directory contains regular weekly lab tasks for the Object-Oriented Programming course.

## Structure

Each lab task should be organized in its own subdirectory with the following naming convention:
- `Lab_01/`
- `Lab_02/`
- `Lab_03/`
- etc.

## Guidelines

- Include source code files
- Add comments explaining the implementation
- Include any required documentation or screenshots
