# Lab Tasks

This directory contains all regular lab tasks for the OOP course.

## Structure

Each lab task should be organized in its own subdirectory (e.g., `Lab1`, `Lab2`, etc.).

### Example:
```
Lab Tasks/
├── Lab1/
│   ├── Task1.cpp
│   ├── Task2.cpp
│   └── README.md
├── Lab2/
│   ├── Task1.cpp
│   └── README.md
```

## Guidelines

- Create a separate folder for each lab session
- Include a README.md in each lab folder with task descriptions
- Use clear, descriptive names for your code files
- Comment your code appropriately
